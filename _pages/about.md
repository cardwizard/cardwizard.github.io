Hello! I'm Aadesh, a software engineer based out of Maryland. I enjoy creating software tools to make life easier. 
I am a MS in Computer Science student at the [University of Maryland](https://www.cs.umd.edu/) where I work as a Research Assistant with 
[Prof. Jim Purtilo](https://seam.cs.umd.edu/purtilo/) in the [SEAM lab](https://seam.cs.umd.edu/team).  

I interned at [Netflix](www.netflix.com) in Summer '20 where I worked with the Customer Trust team. Prior to this, I was a 
Senior Software Engineer at [Soroco](www.soroco.com) where I helped the team build their process discovery platform. 

I received my Bachelors in Technology (B.Tech) in Computer Science from National Institute of Technology, Surat in 2016.
During my Bachelors', I worked on Computer Vision with [Prof. M.A. Zaveri](https://svnit.ac.in/maz/).

I moonlight as a close-up magician and a musician during my free time. I love hosting people on my 
[podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3NYEAofUQ) where we talk philosophy.
