Interactive multiplayer gaming has always been an active area of development. However, most games rely on external  devices for input, such as keyboard, mouse, PS4 controllers etc. These devices support a limited set of actions including button presses or joystick movements, and are often lacking motion sensing capabilities. In addition to this, most of these devices are expensive (\$50-\$60). Smartphones on the other hand are ubiquitous and consist of a rich set of sensors that let users control and interact with the environment. In our research, we show how a smartphone can be used as a low-latency input device for playing real-time multiplayer games. We show that information from smartphone sensors can be used to do basic motion sensing. Our method allows users to perform natural actions, such as steering a wheel, as opposed to key presses while playing racing games in order to provide a more immersive gaming experience.
